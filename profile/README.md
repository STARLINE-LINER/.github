# Core Branches

When working between branches or creating a new one, it's best to standardize the naming convention for branch names to help developers understand what each branch is for.

Please note that we will be using the Git-flow strategy for managing releases. For more information [Click Here](https://numergent.com/2016-12/Branching-workflow-git-flow-and-github-flow.html)

| Branch    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Usage                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `develop` | The default branch where all ongoing development work converges.<br />All feature/issue-related branches will be branched off from this branch,<br /> and when it's ready for release, a release instance branch<br />will be branched off here | Create feature/fix branches<br />from here and merge them<br />back here once completed<br />and tested |
| `feat/*` | Feature branches, created from the dev branch to isolate<br />development of a specific feature without commits interfering with<br />the default branch | Create a new branch with<br /> `feat/` prefix. All development<br />work for related issue to be<br />worked on here |
| `fix/*`  | Bug fix branches, are similar to feature branches but are<br /> specifically dedicated to fixing bugs in the codebase | Create a new branch with<br />`fix/` prefix. All bug fix<br />work for a related issue to be<br />worked on here |
| `release`   | Release branch contains the all stable versions of the code.<br />When the dev branch is ready to be released with a new tag,<br />the dev branch creates a release-* instance branch and has <br />2 PRs to merge it into both release and dev branch with the<br />changelog | To keep track from a higher<br />level the current progress<br />of the repository and the<br />states ready to be deployed<br />into production env |
| `release-*` | The release instance branch, this is used to create the<br />current release and be merged into release and dev branch.<br />This is part of the git-flow strategy mentioned above and <br />helps to keep the release and dev branch synced                                   | To create the changelog.md<br />after branching from dev<br />and to create the <br />pull requests to merge into<br />both release and dev branch |

        git push origin feat/home-page
     ```
   * Ensure your latest commit has gone through the configured code/commit linting and formatting when pushing your local repository to the remote repository

## Using Github Actions

There are multiple use cases for github actions which can be project specific. For example, Actions can be executed upon new pushes which can help with

* Code Linting
* Build
* Running test cases

For better documentation on how to get started: [Click Here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)

## Creating Pull Requests

1. Developer
   1. Always set PR target branches to `develop`
   2. PR Title MUST follow git conventions:
      - "`feat: add welcome page`"
   3. PRs must be approved by at least one reviewer before merging
   4. Upon approval, the PR is to be merged using `Squash and Merge` merge option
2. Reviewer
   1. Receive a notification via telegram on a new PR
   2. Review the code
   3. Ensure no bad smells and all tests pass
   4. Approve PR

## When ready for release (e.g. from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0):

1. Create a new release version branch (e.g. `git checkout -b release-0.1.0`)
2. Merge develop into `release-0.1.0` branch
3. Add a commit to update changelog (can be auto-generated)
4. Push to remote
5. Create PRs to merge into:
   5a. release branch
   5b. develop branch
6. Use `Merge Commits` as the merge option for both PRs to maintain mirror of develop commit history with release branch


# How to on-board for existing repositories

For existing repositories, each section below describes how to add the features into them, although it is recommended to use all of them, you can selectively implement the features that best fit your project's requirements and workflow, ensuring a smoother integration process.

## Templates

The Templates for new issues or new Pull Requests are added into the organization so all repos are able to use the templates by default. 

## Telegram integration

* Copy .github/workflows into existing repository for Telegram bot integration
* Create a telegram super group for the repository and create 3 topics for git issues, new PRs, and any git commits
* Add [BaseRepoBot](https://t.me/BaseGitRepo_bot) into the group
* Go to repo variables and create 4 variables (e.g. https://github.com/Organisation/Repo/settings/secrets/actions)
  * `TELEGRAM_TOKEN : Telegram Bot's Id here`
* Go to repo variables and create 4 variables (e.g. https://github.com/Organisation/Repo/settings/variables/actions)
  * `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID : Super group's Id here`
  * `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID_ISSUES: thread id for git issues`
  * `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID_PULL_REQUESTS: thread id for PRs`
  * `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID_PUSHES: thread id for git commits`

## Pre-commit hooks

* Copy Hooks folder into your root repo directory
* run `npx husky install`
* Copy the contents from `Hooks/commit-msg` into `.husky/_/commit-msg`
